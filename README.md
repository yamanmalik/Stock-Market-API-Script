# Stock-Market-API-Script
A simple script created with Python that calls a stock market API, utilizes the Pandas library, 
and returns the close price and the userâ€™s return rate on the inputted ticker symbol. I plan to slowly add more complex functionality to this script over time, as
I learn more about handling data from API calls and using the Pandas library.

User must have Python 3.5+, the Pandas Library and the ALPHA_VANTAGE package installed on their machine for the program to run.
